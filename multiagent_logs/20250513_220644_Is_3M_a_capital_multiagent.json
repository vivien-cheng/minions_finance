    "final_answer": [
        "Based on the FY2022 data, 3M can be considered a capital-intensive business. This is indicated by the significant investment in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), which had a net value of $9,178 million after depreciation. Additionally, 3M spent $1,749 million on purchases of PP&E during the year. These figures suggest that 3M requires substantial capital investment to maintain and grow its operations, which is characteristic of a capital-intensive business."
