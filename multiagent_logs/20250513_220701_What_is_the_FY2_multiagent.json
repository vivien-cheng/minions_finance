        "To calculate the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine FY2019 Revenue:**\n   - From the consolidated statements of operations, the total net revenues for FY2019 is $6,489 million.\n\n2. **Determine Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) for FY2018 and FY2019:**\n   - From the consolidated balance sheets:\n     - PP&E at December 31, 2019: $253 million\n     - PP&E at December 31, 2018: $282 million\n\n3. **Calculate the Average PP&E:**\n   - Average PP&E = (PP&E at end of 2018 + PP&E at end of 2019) / 2\n   - Average PP&E = ($282 million + $253 million) / 2 = $267.5 million\n\n4. **Calculate the Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio:**\n   - Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = FY2019 Revenue / Average PP&E\n   - Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = $6,489 million / $267.5 million â‰ˆ 24.26\n\nTherefore, the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard is approximately 24.26."
