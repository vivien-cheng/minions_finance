        "answer": "No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark",
        "justification": "Quick Ratio= (Total current assets-Total inventories)/Total current liabilities\n(15,754-5,280)/10,936",

    },
    "final_answer": [
        "To determine if 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023, we need to calculate the quick ratio using the provided balance sheet data. The quick ratio is calculated as:\n\nQuick Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the data provided for June 30, 2023:\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents = $4,258 million\n- Marketable Securities = $56 million\n- Accounts Receivable = $4,947 million\n- Total Current Liabilities = $10,936 million\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nQuick Ratio = ($4,258 + $56 + $4,947) / $10,936 = $9,261 / $10,936 â‰ˆ 0.85\n\nA quick ratio of 0.85 indicates that 3M has $0.85 in liquid assets for every $1 of current liabilities. Generally, a quick ratio of 1 or above is considered healthy, as it suggests the company can cover its short-term liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory. Therefore, a quick ratio of 0.85 suggests that 3M's liquidity profile is slightly below the ideal threshold, indicating potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations without additional cash inflow or asset liquidation. However, it is not critically low, and the company may still manage its liquidity effectively depending on other factors such as cash flow and credit facilities."
