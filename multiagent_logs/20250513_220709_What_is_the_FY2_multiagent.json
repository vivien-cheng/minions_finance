        "To calculate the FY2017 - FY2019 3-year average of capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard, we need to extract the relevant data from the provided financial statements.\n\n1. **Capital Expenditures (Capex):**\n   - 2017: $155 million\n   - 2018: $131 million\n   - 2019: $116 million\n\n2. **Total Net Revenues:**\n   - 2017: $7,017 million\n   - 2018: $7,500 million\n   - 2019: $6,489 million\n\nNext, we calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue for each year:\n\n- **2017:** (155 / 7,017) * 100 = 2.2%\n- **2018:** (131 / 7,500) * 100 = 1.7%\n- **2019:** (116 / 6,489) * 100 = 1.8%\n\nFinally, we calculate the 3-year average:\n\n(2.2% + 1.7% + 1.8%) / 3 = 1.9%\n\nTherefore, the FY2017 - FY2019 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard is 1.9%."
