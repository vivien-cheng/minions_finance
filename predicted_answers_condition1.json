    "financebench_id_04672": "The year-end FY2018 net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) for 3M is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from the total property, plant, and equipment. According to the balance sheet:\n\n- Total property, plant, and equipment for 2018: $24,873 million\n- Accumulated depreciation for 2018: $16,135 million\n\nNet PP&E = Total property, plant, and equipment - Accumulated depreciation  \nNet PP&E = $24,873 million - $16,135 million  \nNet PP&E = $8,738 million\n\nTherefore, the year-end FY2018 net PP&E for 3M is $8.738 billion.",
    "financebench_id_00499": "To determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, we need to consider the company's investment in capital assets relative to its operations. A capital-intensive business typically requires significant investment in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to generate revenue.\n\nFrom the provided data for FY2022:\n\n- **Purchases of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):** $1,749 million\n- **Net Sales:** $34,229 million\n\nThe ratio of capital expenditures (CapEx) to net sales can be used as an indicator of capital intensity. For 3M in 2022, this ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CapEx to Sales Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Purchases of PP&E}}{\\text{Net Sales}} = \\frac{1,749}{34,229} \\approx 0.051 \\text{ or } 5.1\\% \\]\n\nThis ratio indicates that 3M spends about 5.1% of its net sales on capital expenditures. While this is a significant investment, it is not exceptionally high compared to industries that are traditionally considered capital-intensive, such as utilities or manufacturing sectors with heavy machinery requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the net property, plant, and equipment value on the balance sheet is $9,178 million, which is a substantial portion of the total assets ($46,455 million), further indicating a significant investment in capital assets.\n\nBased on this analysis, 3M does exhibit characteristics of a capital-intensive business, as it requires substantial investment in PP&E to support its operations. However, the degree of capital intensity is moderate compared to more heavily capital-intensive industries.",
    "financebench_id_01226": "The operating margin for 3M in FY2022 was influenced by several factors. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was a significant driver of the change in operating margin. This increase was primarily due to:\n\n1. **Special Item Costs**: There were substantial costs related to significant litigation, particularly the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n2. **Impairment Costs**: Costs associated with exiting PFAS manufacturing contributed to the increased SG&A expenses.\n\n3. **Costs Related to Exiting Russia**: The decision to exit the Russian market also added to the SG&A expenses.\n\n4. **Divestiture-Related Restructuring Charges**: These charges were incurred as part of restructuring efforts related to divestitures.\n\n5. **Investment in Growth Initiatives**: Continued investment in key growth initiatives further increased SG&A expenses.\n\nThese factors collectively increased SG&A expenses, which, as a percentage of sales, negatively impacted the operating margin. However, there were some offsets due to restructuring benefits and ongoing general cost management efforts by 3M.\n\nOperating margin is a useful metric for a company like 3M, as it provides insight into the company's efficiency in managing its operating expenses relative to its sales. It helps in understanding how well the company is controlling its costs and generating profit from its core operations, despite the extraordinary expenses and strategic decisions impacting the financials in 2022.",
    "financebench_id_01865": "If we exclude the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), we focus on the organic sales change and the translation impact. The segment that has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022 is the Consumer segment, which shows a negative organic sales change of (0.9)%.",
    "financebench_id_00807": "To assess 3M's liquidity profile using the quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023, we need to calculate the quick ratio, which is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The quick ratio is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Marketable Securities} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nUsing the data provided for June 30, 2023:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $4,258 million\n- Marketable securities: $56 million\n- Accounts receivable: $4,947 million\n- Total current liabilities: $10,936 million\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{4,258 + 56 + 4,947}{10,936} = \\frac{9,261}{10,936} \\approx 0.85 \\]\n\nA quick ratio of 1 or higher is generally considered healthy, as it indicates that the company has enough liquid assets to cover its current liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory. In this case, 3M's quick ratio of approximately 0.85 suggests that it may not have a fully healthy liquidity profile, as it does not have enough liquid assets to cover its current liabilities without relying on inventory.\n\nTherefore, based on the quick ratio, 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile for Q2 of FY2023. However, it's important to consider other factors and metrics for a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health.",

    "financebench_id_07966": "To calculate the 3-year average of capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Capex and Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - Capex (from the cash flow statement):\n     - 2017: $155 million\n     - 2018: $131 million\n     - 2019: $116 million\n   - Total Net Revenues (from the income statement):\n     - 2017: $7,017 million\n     - 2018: $7,500 million\n     - 2019: $6,489 million\n\n2. **Calculate Capex as a Percentage of Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - 2017: \\((155 / 7,017) \\times 100 = 2.2\\%\\)\n   - 2018: \\((131 / 7,500) \\times 100 = 1.7\\%\\)\n   - 2019: \\((116 / 6,489) \\times 100 = 1.8\\%\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the 3-Year Average:**\n   - Average = \\((2.2 + 1.7 + 1.8) / 3 = 1.9\\%\\)\n\nTherefore, the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019 is **1.9%**."
