    "financebench_id_04672": "The year-end FY2018 net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) for 3M is $8.738 billion.",
    "financebench_id_00499": "To determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, we need to consider the company's investment in capital assets relative to its operations. A capital-intensive business typically requires significant investment in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to generate revenue.\n\nFrom the provided data for FY2022:\n\n- Purchases of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) were $1,749 million.\n- Net sales were $34,229 million.\n\nTo assess capital intensity, we can look at the ratio of capital expenditures (CapEx) to net sales:\n\n\\[ \\text{CapEx to Sales Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Purchases of PP&E}}{\\text{Net Sales}} = \\frac{1,749}{34,229} \\approx 0.051 \\text{ or } 5.1\\% \\]\n\nA CapEx to Sales Ratio of 5.1% suggests that 3M invests a moderate portion of its sales revenue back into capital assets. While this indicates some level of capital intensity, it is not exceptionally high compared to industries that are traditionally considered capital-intensive, such as manufacturing or utilities, where this ratio can be significantly higher.\n\nAdditionally, the net property, plant, and equipment value on the balance sheet is $9,178 million, which is a substantial portion of the total assets ($46,455 million), further indicating a significant investment in capital assets.\n\nOverall, while 3M does have a notable investment in capital assets, the CapEx to Sales Ratio suggests it is not extremely capital-intensive compared to more asset-heavy industries. However, it does require a considerable amount of capital investment to maintain and grow its operations.",
    "financebench_id_01226": "The operating margin for 3M in FY2022 was influenced by several factors. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales indicates that operating costs rose relative to sales, which typically pressures operating margins. The key drivers for this increase in SG&A were:\n\n1. **Litigation Costs**: A significant pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion was incurred due to litigation related to Combat Arms Earplugs, which directly impacted operating expenses.\n\n2. **Impairment Costs**: Costs associated with exiting PFAS manufacturing contributed to higher operating expenses.\n\n3. **Costs Related to Exiting Russia**: These costs added to the overall SG&A expenses, affecting the operating margin.\n\n4. **Divestiture-Related Restructuring Charges**: These charges also increased operating expenses.\n\n5. **Investment in Growth Initiatives**: Continued investment in key growth initiatives increased SG&A expenses, impacting the operating margin.\n\nThese increases in operating expenses were partially offset by restructuring benefits and general cost management efforts by 3M. However, the net effect of these factors likely resulted in a decrease in operating margin, as the increase in expenses outpaced any cost savings or efficiencies gained.\n\nOperating margin is a useful metric for a company like 3M, as it provides insight into the company's ability to manage its operating costs relative to its sales. It reflects the efficiency of the company's core business operations and its ability to generate profit from sales before interest and taxes. Therefore, analyzing changes in operating margin can help assess the impact of various strategic and operational decisions on the company's financial performance.",
    "financebench_id_01865": "If we exclude the impact of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), we focus on the organic sales change and the translation impact. The segment that has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022 is the Consumer segment, which shows a negative organic sales change of (0.9)%.",
    "financebench_id_00807": "To assess 3M's liquidity profile using the quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023, we need to calculate the quick ratio, which is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The quick ratio is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Marketable Securities} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet data for June 30, 2023:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $4,258 million\n- Marketable securities: $56 million\n- Accounts receivable: $4,947 million\n- Total current liabilities: $10,936 million\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{4,258 + 56 + 4,947}{10,936} = \\frac{9,261}{10,936} \\approx 0.85 \\]\n\nA quick ratio of 1 or higher is generally considered healthy, as it indicates that the company has enough liquid assets to cover its current liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory. In this case, 3M's quick ratio is approximately 0.85, which is below 1. This suggests that 3M may not have a sufficiently healthy liquidity profile based solely on its quick ratio, as it indicates that the company might struggle to cover its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider other factors and metrics when assessing a company's overall financial health, as the quick ratio is just one measure of liquidity.",

    "financebench_id_07966": "To calculate the 3-year average of capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Capex and Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - Capex (from the cash flow statement):\n     - 2017: $155 million\n     - 2018: $131 million\n     - 2019: $116 million\n   - Total Net Revenues (from the income statement):\n     - 2017: $7,017 million\n     - 2018: $7,500 million\n     - 2019: $6,489 million\n\n2. **Calculate Capex as a Percentage of Revenue for Each Year:**\n   - 2017: \\((155 / 7,017) \\times 100 = 2.2\\%\\)\n   - 2018: \\((131 / 7,500) \\times 100 = 1.7\\%\\)\n   - 2019: \\((116 / 6,489) \\times 100 = 1.8\\%\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the 3-Year Average:**\n   - Average = \\((2.2 + 1.7 + 1.8) / 3 = 1.9\\%\\)\n\nTherefore, the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019 is **1.9%**."
