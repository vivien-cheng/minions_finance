    "financebench_id_01226": "The operating margin for 3M in FY2022 was primarily impacted by increased SG&A expenses due to litigation costs of approximately $1.20 billion related to the Combat Arms Earplugs, impairment costs from exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia, and restructuring charges for divestitures. These increased costs reduced the operating margin. However, restructuring benefits and general cost management partially offset these expenses. Despite these challenges, operating margin remains a useful metric for 3M as it reflects the company's ability to manage operating expenses relative to revenue.",
